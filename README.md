This project was carried out as part of my Web Developer studies at OpenClassrooms. 

The company wants to develop a website that allows users to find accommodation and activities in the city of their choice.

I was in charge of integrating the interface of the website with HTML and CSS code based on mockups.

Skills  assessed: 

- Establish a front-end development environment.
- Versioning the project with Git and Github.
- Integrate content according to a mockup with HTML and CSS.
- Implement a responsive interface with HTML and CSS.
